# Editor Plugins for Elm

Elm users should have a consistent and pleasant experience across a broad range of editors.

A core team member has reviewed each of the plugins listed here to make sure it matches [the specifications](specifications.md) and has good performance.

**If you are new to Elm**, just start with the **Elm Syntax Highlighting** plugin.

**If you do not have a code editor yet**, I like using [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) with [these settings](https://gist.github.com/evancz/1eef86cc99632e15a8f4d793bbda3d1f).
